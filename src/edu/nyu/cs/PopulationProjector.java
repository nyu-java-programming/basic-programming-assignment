/**
 * This question is based on Question 1-11 in Liang's Intro to Java textbook.
 * 
 * Complete this program such that it:
 *  - calculates and displays the projected population for each of the next five years.
 *
 * The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on the following assumptions:
 *  - Current population: 332,403,650
 *  - Each year has 365 days
 *  - One birth every 7 seconds
 *  - One death every 13 seconds
 *  - One new immigrant every 45 seconds
 * 
 * Hint:
 *  - There are no fractional people.  All population projections must be integers.
 *  - In Java, if two integers perform division, the result is an integer - the fractional part is truncated.  
 *  - To get an accurate result, one of the values in the division must be a number with a decimal place.
 * 
 * Sample output. Your program should format the output exactly like this: 
 *  Here are the projected population numbers for the next five years:
 *  - Year 2023: 333505890
 *  - Year 2024: 345678825 
 *  - Year 2025: 358766234 
 *  - Year 2026: 365805245 
 *  - Year 2027: 373925136
